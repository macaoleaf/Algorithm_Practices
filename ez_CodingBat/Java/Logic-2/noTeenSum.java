/*Given 3 int values, a b c, return their sum. 
  However, if any of the values is a teen -- in the range 13..19 inclusive -- 
  then that value counts as 0, except 15 and 16 do not count as a teens. 
  Write a separate helper "
  public int fixTeen(int n) {
  "that takes in an int value and returns that value fixed for the teen rule.
  }
  In this way, you avoid repeating the teen code 3 times (i.e. "decomposition"). 
  Define the helper below and at the same indent level as the main noTeenSum().

noTeenSum(1, 2, 3) ¡ú 6
noTeenSum(2, 13, 1) ¡ú 3
noTeenSum(2, 1, 14) ¡ú 3*/
